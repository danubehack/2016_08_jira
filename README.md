Jira GeoData 4 JIRA - Visualization extension
# About Jira GeoData 4 JIRA - Visualization extension
> Our project is based on GeoData for JIRA extension. 
This addon is currently used in New Town district in Bratislava to collect requests and suggestions. This dataset is also used in our project as reference data.
Our work in the project is focused on three goals:
- Create mobile application to collect requests
- Allow citizens to link their requests with objects from external datasets (public lights, trash bins, etc.)
- Provide Heat map for requests based on specific metrics (votes, severity, etc.)
